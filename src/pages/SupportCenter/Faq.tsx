    question: "What is a Web3 solution?",
    answer: (

        A Web3 solution uses decentralized technologies like blockchain and

        storage, and Web3 wallets with traditional systemsâ€”not only for seamless
        operation but also to reduce costs, increase trust, and ensure greater
        resilience.
