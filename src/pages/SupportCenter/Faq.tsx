    answer:
      "A Web3 solution uses decentralized technologies like blockchain and smart contracts to meet specific business or user needs. It can involve building new decentralized systems or enabling Web3 functionality in existing applications. Web3 solutions aim to enhance security, give users more control over their data, and improve transparency and efficiency. They often involve integrating components like smart contracts, decentralized storage, and Web3 wallets with traditional systemsâ€”not only for seamless operation but also to reduce costs, increase trust, and ensure greater resilience.",
